**Automatic Graph Visualization** 
Abstract

In this bachelor’s thesis force-directed algorithm is described for automatic graph visualisation. We described Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and its usage of simula- ted annealing to minimize the energy of the system and to achive better vertex layout. Based on results for various graphs, considering number of vertices, we discuss the problem of force calculation among vertices which is executed in quadratic time com- plexity.

We considered Barnes-Hut algorithm for speeding up the force calculation between vertices and we used simulated annealing in order to achieve better inital graph layout, before we actually run the force-directed algorithm. Using these approaches we im- plemented our own graph visualisation tool which supports real-time interaction with graph during the layout process.
